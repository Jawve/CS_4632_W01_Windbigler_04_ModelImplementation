# Macro-Application3892

This research simulates and evaluates the effectiveness of military strategies in the game, Age of Empires IV, monitoring three civilizations: English, French, and Chinese. Using in-game mechanics, we simulate historical tactics and assess their relative effectiveness in a controlled, non-historical environment. The study offers new perspectives on the application of RTS games for academic research and historical analysis.

Since AOE IV has many in game tools for simulations, the deliverable for this assignment deals with macro commands. This is a program that is used to mimic inputs, which is important for controlled testing. Currently, I used other macro applications to complete current research. For This deliverable, I will create my own macro application. This tool is important to reduce human participation in the simulation, as mechanics such as kiting ( A strategy used by the English where archers would retreat while attacking) requires human input. For this, A macro application would be appropriate to automize the process. 

Currently, I am researching xbox's tos and autoban. Since macros are considered cheating, I would like to make sure I dont break these rules, as this may cause my account to be banned therefore research will be haulted. Unfortunately, since my testing is done through the xbox platform, I will have to stay online for the testing, meaning I will have to make my program work with the xbox application.
